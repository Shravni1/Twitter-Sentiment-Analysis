# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
This is my task during the internship at Nexus, where  I undertook the task of creating a machine learning model .
During my Nexus internship, I took on the challenge of building a Twitter sentiment analysis model. I began by defining the problem and then collected and cleaned a labeled dataset for training and testing. Using data visualization, I identified patterns and preprocessed the data for the chosen model, considering options like Naive Bayes or Support Vector Machines. After splitting the dataset for training, I evaluated the model's reliability with metrics like accuracy. This experience provided hands-on learning in the entire process of developing a machine learning model for sentiment analysis.
